### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

If you wan to contact me, then send a message on telegram [@c_v_ya](https://t.me/c_v_ya).
Or email me to [ceeveeya@gmail.com](mailto:ceeveeya@gmail.com).
Definitely connect on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/constantine-yarushkin) just because :blush:

Also I have a tech [blog](https://c-v-ya.github.io/blog) which is hosted with GitHub pages. Go check that out!

If you ask me what I'm proud of, then it will be a time tracking [project](https://github.com/c-v-ya/time-left). Mainly because this is my first React project and I don't really do frontend. But this one turned out nice (I think). And it serves a concrete purpose.

If you're just looking for a code sample to see how I write code you can checkout this [repository](https://github.com/c-v-ya/likers).
